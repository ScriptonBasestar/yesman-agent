# Pre-commit configuration for Yesman-Claude project (Optimized Development Flow)
# Strategy: pre-commit (ultra-light), pre-push (comprehensive)

# pre-commit:  Only essential fixes + formatting (1-3s)
# pre-push:    Full validation (lint + tests) (5-10s)
# Run with: pre-commit run --all-files

# =============================================================================
# Global Configuration - Two-Stage Quality Strategy
# =============================================================================

# Install both pre-commit and pre-push hooks by default
default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push]
default_stages: [pre-commit]  # Most hooks run on pre-commit by default

# CI configuration (pre-commit.ci service)
ci:
  autofix_commit_msg: |
    fix(format): automated formatting and essential fixes
    
    Applied by pre-commit.ci - only essential code formatting
    Comprehensive validation happens at pre-push stage

  autoupdate_schedule: weekly

  submodules: false

# =============================================================================
# OPTIMIZED STRATEGY:
# 
# pre-commit (1-3s):  Essential fixes only
#   - Code formatting (ruff-format)
#   - Safe auto-fixes (ruff --fix essential rules)
#   - Final validation (ruff check same rules)
#   - Merge conflict detection
#   - Large file check
#
# pre-push (5-10s):   Comprehensive validation
#   - Markdown formatting check
#   - Type checking (mypy)
#   - Security scanning (bandit)
#   - Debug statement detection
#   - YAML/JSON validation
#   - Fast tests
#
# Usage:
#   1. Install: make hooks-install
#   2. Develop: git commit (fast pre-commit)
#   3. Push: git push (comprehensive pre-push)
#   4. Manual: pre-commit run --all-files
