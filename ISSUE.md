# Yesman-Claude Issues Found During Testing (RESOLVED)

## Issue #1: Directory Validation Error in Setup Command ✅ RESOLVED

### Description
When running `./yesman.py setup`, the command fails to create the 'dripter' session due to a non-existent directory.

### Resolution
- **Fixed in**: `commands/setup.py:98-99`
- **Solution**: Added proper validation flag handling to skip session creation when window directory validation fails
- **Enhancement**: Added interactive prompts to offer directory creation for missing paths

---

## Issue #2: Better Error Handling for Missing Directories ✅ RESOLVED

### Description
The application should provide options to create missing directories or skip problematic sessions during setup.

### Resolution
- **Fixed in**: `commands/setup.py:67-76, 99-110`
- **Solution**: Added interactive prompts asking users whether to create missing directories
- **Enhancement**: Graceful skipping of sessions with missing directories while continuing with other sessions

---

## Issue #3: Improve Enter Command for Non-Interactive Environments ✅ RESOLVED

### Description
The `enter` command fails in non-interactive environments (like piped input) with "open terminal failed: not a terminal".

### Resolution
- **Fixed in**: `commands/enter.py:78-81`
- **Solution**: Added `sys.stdin.isatty()` check to detect non-interactive environments
- **Enhancement**: Provides clear error message with helpful tips when used in pipes or scripts

## Issue #4: Add Validation for Template References ⏸️ LOW PRIORITY

### Description
Projects reference templates (e.g., "template: none") but there's no validation to ensure templates exist when specified.

### Status
- **Current**: Template validation exists in `commands/setup.py:32-34`
- **Note**: Issue doesn't block functionality as most projects use "template: none"
- **Priority**: Low - existing validation is sufficient for current usage

---

## Resolution Summary
- ✅ **All critical issues resolved**
- ✅ **Directory validation and interactive prompts implemented**
- ✅ **Better error handling with graceful session skipping**
- ✅ **Terminal detection for enter command**
- ⏸️ **Template validation marked as low priority (existing validation sufficient)**
