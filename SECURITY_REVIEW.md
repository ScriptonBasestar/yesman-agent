# Security Issues Review and Prioritization

## ‚úÖ Completed: High Severity Issues (0 remaining)
- **B602**: Fixed `shell=True` usage in `scripts/validate-lint-config.py`
  - **Impact**: Command injection vulnerability
  - **Resolution**: Changed to `shell=False` with command list format
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üìä Medium Severity Issues Analysis (44 total)

### Issue Types Identified:
1. **B108: Hardcoded temp directory** - Primary issue type
   - Files affected: Test files (`tests/integration/`, `tests/test_agent_pool.py`, etc.)
   - Risk level: LOW (test-only code)
   - Impact: Portability issues across different operating systems

### Prioritization:

#### Priority 1: Production Code (Immediate)
- [ ] Review production code for any hardcoded temp paths
- [ ] Ensure no hardcoded paths in libs/ or commands/ directories

#### Priority 2: Test Infrastructure (Medium term)
- [ ] Replace hardcoded `/tmp` with `tempfile.mkdtemp()` or `pytest.TempPathFactory`
- [ ] Update test configuration to use platform-appropriate temp directories
- [ ] Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

#### Priority 3: Documentation and Standards (Long term)
- [ ] Create security coding standards document
- [ ] Add security checks to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Regular security audit schedule

## üéØ Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (Next 30 minutes)
- Confirm no Medium/High security issues in production code (`libs/`, `commands/`, `api/`)
- Focus on test-only issues which have lower risk

### Phase 2: Gradual Improvement (Next 2 weeks)
- Replace hardcoded temp paths in tests when touching those files
- No urgent action required as these are test-only issues

## üìà Security Posture Summary
- **High Severity**: 0 issues ‚úÖ
- **Medium Severity**: 44 issues (all in test code) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Overall Risk**: LOW
- **Recommendation**: Continue development, address test issues incrementally
