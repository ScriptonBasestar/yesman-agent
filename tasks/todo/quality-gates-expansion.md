## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Quality Validation

Extend the existing quality gates system with additional automated checks for comprehensive code validation.

## ‚úÖ Action Items

- [ ] **Add security vulnerability scanning** - enhance bandit integration
- [ ] **Implement dependency version checking** - detect outdated packages
- [ ] **Add license compliance validation** - ensure legal compliance
- [ ] **Create code coverage regression detection** - prevent test coverage drops
- [ ] **Set performance regression thresholds** - automated performance monitoring

## ‚úèÔ∏è Implementation Details

**New Quality Gates Architecture**:
```python
# New quality gates to add:
- Security vulnerability scanning (bandit enhanced)
- Dependency version checking
- License compliance validation
- Code coverage regression detection
- Performance regression thresholds
```

**Integration Strategy**:
- Extend existing `scripts/run_quality_gates.py`
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Add configurable thresholds
- Implement failing gate notifications

**Monitoring and Reporting**:
- Add detailed quality reports
- Track quality trends over time
- Set up quality gate failure alerts
- Create quality dashboard integration
