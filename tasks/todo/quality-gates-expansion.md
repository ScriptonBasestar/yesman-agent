# Quality Gates System Expansion

> **Priority**: Medium  
> **Timeline**: Next 1-3 months

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Quality Validation

Extend the existing quality gates system with additional automated checks for comprehensive code validation.

## ‚úÖ Action Items

- [x] **Add security vulnerability scanning** - enhanced bandit integration with multi-level analysis
- [ ] **Implement dependency version checking** - detect outdated packages
- [ ] **Add license compliance validation** - ensure legal compliance
- [ ] **Create code coverage regression detection** - prevent test coverage drops
- [ ] **Set performance regression thresholds** - automated performance monitoring

## ‚úèÔ∏è Implementation Details

**New Quality Gates Architecture**:
```python
# Completed quality gates enhancements:
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability scanning (bandit enhanced with multi-level analysis)
  * Multi-level severity classification (critical, high, medium, low)
  * Configurable thresholds for each severity level
  * Additional secret detection patterns
  * Enhanced reporting with issue type analysis
  * Performance metrics tracking

# Remaining quality gates to add:
- Dependency version checking
- License compliance validation 
- Code coverage regression detection
- Performance regression thresholds
```

**Integration Strategy**:
- Extend existing `scripts/run_quality_gates.py`
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Add configurable thresholds
- Implement failing gate notifications

**Enhanced Security Scanning Features** (Completed):
- **Multi-Level Gating**: Critical (0 max), High (5 max), Medium (15 max), Low (50 max)
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Customizable timeout, exclude paths, skip tests, confidence/severity thresholds
- **Detailed Analysis**: Issue type trending, sample high-severity issues, confidence breakdown
- **Additional Checks**: Basic secret detection, extensible for dependency/license scanning
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution time monitoring, scan metadata

**Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "blocking_gates": {
    "security_critical_issues_max": 0,
    "security_high_issues_max": 5
  },
  "warning_gates": {
    "security_medium_issues_max": 15
  },
  "security_config": {
    "timeout_seconds": 60,
    "exclude_paths": ["./.backups", "./.venv", "./node_modules"],
    "confidence_threshold": "LOW",
    "severity_threshold": "LOW"
  }
}
```

**Monitoring and Reporting**:
- Add detailed quality reports
- Track quality trends over time
- Set up quality gate failure alerts
- Create quality dashboard integration
