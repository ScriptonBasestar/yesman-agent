# Performance-Security Integration Optimization

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Dependencies:** Completed security validation system, monitoring dashboard integration

## Overview

Integrate the completed security validation system with the monitoring dashboard to create comprehensive security-performance visibility. This builds directly on the comprehensive security infrastructure and monitoring dashboard that were recently implemented.

## Problem Statement

Currently, security validation and performance monitoring operate as separate systems. This creates:

- **Information Silos**: Security and performance teams lack visibility into each other's metrics
- **Missed Correlations**: Cannot identify when security scans impact performance or vice versa  
- **Fragmented Alerting**: Separate alert systems for security and performance issues
- **Inefficient Troubleshooting**: No single source of truth for system health

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Security Metrics Integration (Day 1)

**1.1 Extend MetricType Enum**
```python
# Add to libs/dashboard/monitoring_integration.py
class MetricType(Enum):
    # ... existing metrics ...
    SECURITY_SCAN_TIME = "security_scan_time"
    SECURITY_VIOLATIONS = "security_violations"
    SECURITY_FALSE_POSITIVES = "security_false_positives"
    VULNERABILITY_COUNT = "vulnerability_count"
```

**1.2 Create SecurityMetrics Data Structure**
```python
@dataclass
class SecurityMetrics:
    scan_duration_ms: float
    violations_found: int
    false_positive_rate: float
    vulnerability_severity_counts: dict[str, int]
    scan_coverage_percent: float
```

**1.3 Extend SecurityValidator**
- Add timing instrumentation to security scans
- Implement metrics collection and publishing via event bus
- Add security scan result caching for performance

### Phase 2: Dashboard Integration (Day 1-2)

**2.1 Security Dashboard Components**
- Create `SecurityMetricsWidget.svelte` for real-time security status
- Add security violation trends to existing performance charts
- Implement security-performance correlation views

**2.2 Alert System Enhancement**
- Add security alert thresholds to existing `AlertThreshold` system
- Implement security-performance correlation alerts
- Create unified alert dashboard showing both metric types

### Phase 3: Quality Gates Enhancement (Day 2-3)

**3.1 Unified Quality Gates**
- Extend `QualityGatesPerformanceChecker` to include security checks
- Add blocking rules for critical security violations
- Implement security-performance regression detection

**3.2 Correlation Analytics**
- Track security scan impact on system performance
- Identify performance bottlenecks caused by security processes
- Generate optimization recommendations

### Event Bus Integration

```python
# New event types to add
class SecurityEvent:
    scan_completed: dict  # Security scan results with timing
    violation_detected: dict  # Individual security violations
    baseline_updated: dict  # Security baseline changes

# Integration in monitoring_integration.py
async def _handle_security_metrics(self, event: Event) -> None:
    """Handle security metrics and correlate with performance."""
    security_data = event.data
    
    # Store security metrics alongside performance metrics
    # Check for performance impact of security scans
    # Generate correlation insights
```

## Testing Strategy
