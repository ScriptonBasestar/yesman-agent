## 🚨 Priority 1: Production Code Review (Critical)

Verify no security vulnerabilities exist in production components. All remaining security issues are in test code, but verification is required.

## ✅ Immediate Action Items

- [x] **Review production code for hardcoded temp paths** - scan libs/ and commands/ directories
- [x] **Verify no hardcoded paths in core components** - ensure secure path handling

## ✏️ Current Security Context

**Status Summary**:
- ✅ High Severity: 0 issues (B602 command injection fixed)
- ⚠️ Medium Severity: 44 issues (all confirmed in test code only)  
- 📊 Overall Risk: LOW
- 💡 Immediate Risk: NONE (production code appears clean)

**Verification Focus**:
- Production directories: `libs/`, `commands/`, `api/`
- Look for hardcoded `/tmp` or similar paths
- Verify secure path handling practices
- Expected result: No production security issues found

**Timeline**: 30-minute verification sufficient due to low risk assessment.
