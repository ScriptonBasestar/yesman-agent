## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Details

**Real-time Dashboard Integration**:
- Extend existing Tauri dashboard with performance metrics visualization
- Add component-level performance charts (response times, memory usage, CPU utilization)
- Integrate event bus queue depth monitoring with real-time graphs
- Display network I/O patterns and throughput statistics

**Automated Alerting System**:
```python
# Alert configuration examples
ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    'response_time_ms': 100,      # Component response time
    'memory_delta_mb': 5,         # Memory usage per operation  
    'cpu_percent': 50,            # CPU utilization
    'queue_utilization': 80,      # Event bus queue depth
    'network_throughput_mb': 1    # Network I/O threshold
}
```

**Quality Gates Integration**:
- Add performance metrics to quality_gates_checker.py
- Set performance regression thresholds
- Include monitoring health in overall quality score
- Generate performance reports in quality gates output

**Performance Baseline Enhancement**:
- Extend baseline system to track historical performance trends
- Implement performance regression detection algorithms
- Generate performance improvement recommendations
- Create automated performance optimization suggestions

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Real-time visibility into system performance bottlenecks
- Automated detection of performance degradation
- Integration with existing quality assurance processes
- Historical performance trend analysis capabilities
