## üìä Enhanced Monitoring Goals

Extend the existing performance baseline system with granular metrics and real-time dashboards.

## ‚úÖ Action Items

- [x] **Add event bus queue depth monitoring** - track processing backlog
- [x] **Implement individual component response times** - identify bottlenecks
- [x] **Add memory usage per component tracking** - detect memory leaks
- [x] **Monitor CPU utilization per async task** - optimize resource usage
- [x] **Track network I/O patterns** - understand data flow

## üéâ Completion Summary

**Status**: All tasks completed successfully  
**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Commit**: `feat(monitoring): implement comprehensive performance monitoring system` (5cc24c1)

**Key Achievements**:
- Enhanced AsyncEventBus with queue depth monitoring (utilization, backlog tracking, overflow detection)
- Added component response time tracking for 6 core components with statistical analysis
- Implemented memory usage tracking per component with leak detection
- Added CPU utilization monitoring with efficiency metrics
- Implemented network I/O pattern tracking with throughput analysis
- Created comprehensive documentation (performance-monitoring.md, monitoring-configuration.md)
- Added bottleneck detection with configurable thresholds
- Comprehensive test suite validating all functionality

**Impact**: 1,525 lines added providing deep system performance visibility

## ‚úèÔ∏è Implementation Details

**Metrics Collection Strategy**:
```python
# Additional metrics to implement:
- Event bus queue depth monitoring
- Individual component response times  
- Memory usage per component
- CPU utilization per async task
- Network I/O patterns
```

**Dashboard Integration**:
- Extend existing AsyncClaudeMonitor with new metrics
- Add real-time visualization capabilities
- Integrate with performance baseline system
- Set up alerting thresholds for critical metrics

**Data Storage**:
- Use existing performance_data/ structure
- Implement metric rotation and archival
- Ensure minimal performance impact from monitoring
