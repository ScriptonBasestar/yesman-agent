## 🚨 Priority 1: Production Code Review (Critical - Immediate)

Verify no security vulnerabilities exist in production components.

## ✅ Action Items

- [x] **Review production code for hardcoded temp paths** - scan libs/ and commands/ directories [MOVED to security-immediate.md]
- [x] **Verify no hardcoded paths in core components** - ensure secure path handling [MOVED to security-immediate.md]

## 📋 Priority 2: Test Infrastructure (Medium - 2 weeks)

Address 44 medium-severity security issues in test code (B108: Hardcoded temp directory).

## ✅ Action Items  

- [x] **Replace hardcoded `/tmp` with `tempfile.mkdtemp()`** - use proper temp handling [MOVED to security-medium-term.md]
- [x] **Update test configuration** - platform-appropriate temp directories [MOVED to security-medium-term.md]
- [x] **Estimate 2-3 hours effort** - plan implementation timeline [MOVED to security-medium-term.md]

## 📚 Priority 3: Security Standards (Long-term)

Establish ongoing security practices and documentation.

## ✅ Action Items

- [x] **Create security coding standards document** - establish team guidelines [MOVED to security-long-term.md]
- [x] **Add security checks to pre-commit hooks** - automated prevention [MOVED to security-long-term.md]
- [x] **Establish regular security audit schedule** - ongoing monitoring [MOVED to security-long-term.md]

## ✏️ Current Security Posture

**Status Summary**:
- ✅ High Severity: 0 issues (B602 fixed)
- ⚠️ Medium Severity: 44 issues (all in test code)  
- 📊 Overall Risk: LOW
- 💡 Recommendation: Continue development, address incrementally

**Risk Assessment**: All remaining issues are in test code with low production impact.
