## ✅ Completed: High Severity Issues (0 remaining)

- **B602**: Fixed `shell=True` usage in `scripts/validate-lint-config.py`
  - **Impact**: Command injection vulnerability
  - **Resolution**: Changed to `shell=False` with command list format
  - **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## 📊 Medium Severity Issues Analysis (44 total)

### Issue Types Identified:

1. **B108: Hardcoded temp directory** - Primary issue type
   - Files affected: Test files (`tests/integration/`, `tests/test_agent_pool.py`, etc.)
   - Risk level: LOW (test-only code)
   - Impact: Portability issues across different operating systems

### Prioritization:

#### Priority 1: Production Code (Immediate)

- [x] Review production code for any hardcoded temp paths [MOVED to security-priorities.md]
- [x] Ensure no hardcoded paths in libs/ or commands/ directories [MOVED to security-priorities.md]

#### Priority 2: Test Infrastructure (Medium term)

- [x] Replace hardcoded `/tmp` with `tempfile.mkdtemp()` or `pytest.TempPathFactory` [MOVED to security-priorities.md]
- [x] Update test configuration to use platform-appropriate temp directories [MOVED to security-priorities.md]
- [x] Estimated effort: 2-3 hours [MOVED to security-priorities.md]

#### Priority 3: Documentation and Standards (Long term)

- [x] Create security coding standards document [MOVED to security-priorities.md]
- [x] Add security checks to pre-commit hooks [MOVED to security-priorities.md]
- [x] Regular security audit schedule [MOVED to security-priorities.md]

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (Next 30 minutes)

- Confirm no Medium/High security issues in production code (`libs/`, `commands/`, `api/`)
- Focus on test-only issues which have lower risk

### Phase 2: Gradual Improvement (Next 2 weeks)

- Replace hardcoded temp paths in tests when touching those files
- No urgent action required as these are test-only issues

## 📈 Security Posture Summary

- **High Severity**: 0 issues ✅
- **Medium Severity**: 44 issues (all in test code) ⚠️
- **Overall Risk**: LOW
- **Recommendation**: Continue development, address test issues incrementally
