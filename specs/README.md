# Specifications Directory

This directory contains core design documents and specifications that define the fundamental architecture and design decisions of the Yesman-Claude project.

## ðŸ”’ Protection Level: HIGH

**All files in this directory are protected from AI modification.**

## Directory Structure

- `architecture/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `design/` - Core design documents and technical specifications
- `requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
- `ai-guidelines/` - Guidelines for AI agents working with this codebase

## Modification Policy

These documents should only be modified by:

1. Project maintainers
1. Senior developers with architecture decision authority
1. Through formal review processes

## Why These Documents Are Protected

1. **Consistency**: These documents define the core principles and patterns that must be consistently followed throughout the project
1. **Stability**: Frequent changes to fundamental architecture decisions can destabilize the entire project
1. **Authority**: Architecture decisions require human judgment and cannot be delegated to AI agents
1. **Traceability**: All changes to these documents must be traceable to specific human decisions

## Adding New Documents

When adding new specification documents:

1. Include the protection header at the top of the file
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
1. Update this README with the new document's purpose
1. Ensure the document is added to version control with proper commit messages

## Document Templates

See individual subdirectories for specific document templates and guidelines.
