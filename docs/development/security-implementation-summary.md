## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**:

   ```bash
   make hooks-install
   # or
   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
   ```

1. **Run Security Validation Manually**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/security_validation.py
   ```

1. **Test Security Hooks**:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --hook-stage pre-push --verbose
   ```

1. **Check Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip-audit --desc
   ```

### For Security Reviews

1. **Follow Security Coding Standards**: Refer to `/docs/development/security-coding-standards.md`
1. **Use Security Review Checklist**: Available in the coding standards document
1. **Run Comprehensive Security Checks**: All security hooks run automatically on pre-push

### For Audits
