### Code Quality Tools

The project uses comprehensive code quality tools:

- **Ruff** for linting, formatting, and import sorting (replaces Black + isort)
- **mypy** for static type checking
- **pytest** for testing with coverage reports
- **bandit** for security vulnerability scanning
- **pre-commit** for automatic quality checks

Quick commands:

```bash
make format      # Format code with Ruff
make lint        # Check code quality
make lint-fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
make test        # Run all tests
make full        # Complete quality check
```

### Configuration Hierarchy

1. Global config: `~/.scripton/yesman/yesman.yaml` (logging, default choices)
1. Session files: `~/.scripton/yesman/sessions/*.yaml` (individual session definitions)
1. Templates: `~/.scripton/yesman/templates/*.yaml` (reusable session templates)
1. Local overrides: `./.scripton/yesman/*` (project-specific configs)

Configuration merge modes:

- `merge` (default): Local configs override global
- `local`: Use only local configs

### Important Implementation Details

1. **Template Processing**: The `setup` command reads templates from `~/.scripton/yesman/templates/` or individual
   session files from `~/.scripton/yesman/sessions/`, and creates tmux sessions.

1. **Session Naming**: Sessions can have different names than their project keys using the `session_name` override.

1. **Claude Manager Operation**: The claude manager implements a sophisticated monitoring system:

   - **DashboardController** (`libs/core/claude_manager.py`): Main controller manageable from the dashboard
   - **Content Collection** (`libs/core/content_collector.py`): Captures tmux pane content efficiently
   - **Prompt Detection** (`libs/core/prompt_detector.py`): Advanced regex-based prompt recognition system
   - **Auto-Response Patterns**: Pattern files in `patterns/` directory (123/, yn/, 12/) for different prompt types
   - **Monitoring Loop**: Captures content every second and detects interactive prompts
   - **Safe Restart**: Properly terminates existing Claude processes before restarting
   - **Caching System**: Advanced caching with analytics (`libs/core/cache_*.py` modules)

1. **Multi-Interface Architecture**:

   - **Tauri Desktop App**: Primary native desktop interface for session monitoring
   - **FastAPI Server**: REST API for programmatic access and integration
   - **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for direct automation and scripting

1. **Error Handling**: Commands check for existing sessions before creation and validate template existence.

1. **Logging**: Configured via `yesman.yaml` with configurable log levels and paths. Claude manager and dashboard use
   separate log files.

## Development Workflow

When working on this codebase:

1. **Adding New Commands**: Create new command files in `commands/` directory and register them in `yesman.py:17-22`
1. **Claude Manager Modifications**:
   - Core logic in `libs/core/claude_manager.py` (DashboardController class)
   - Pattern detection in `libs/core/prompt_detector.py` (ClaudePromptDetector class)
   - Content collection in `libs/core/content_collector.py`
   - Auto-response patterns stored in `patterns/` subdirectories
   - Caching system components in `libs/core/cache_*.py` modules
1. **Dashboard Updates**:
   - Tauri: Native desktop app components in `tauri-dashboard/src/`
   - FastAPI: REST API endpoints in `api/routers/`
   - Web Interface: Browser-based components via Tauri's embedded WebView
1. **Configuration Changes**: Global config structure defined in `YesmanConfig` class (`libs/yesman_config.py`)
1. **Testing**: Use debug scripts in `debug/` directory and test files in `tests/` for component testing

### Pattern-Based Auto-Response System

The system uses pattern files to recognize and respond to different prompt types:

- `patterns/123/`: For numbered selection prompts (1, 2, 3 options)
- `patterns/yn/`: For yes/no binary choices
- `patterns/12/`: For simple binary selections (1/2 options) Each pattern file contains regex patterns to match specific
  prompt formats.
